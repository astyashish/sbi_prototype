External factors include air pollution (high pollution reduces scores), medical infrastructure (better healthcare cities score higher), crime rates (higher crime reduces scores), natural disaster risk (zones prone to disasters reduce scores), state-specific insurance regulations (can impact the score), and cost of living (higher living costs may influence premiums). Users with lower risks, higher income, better health, and living in cities with strong healthcare systems are more likely to buy insurance and will be more profitable for the company."
